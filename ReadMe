Hello, and welcome to this app.

This app is something I am building because I have taken a course in CSS.
Inside there is a playground folder where the little tiny excercises are placed that I had to build in this course.
In this course I am learning about the very basics of CSS incl box-modeling, flexbox and SASS.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective section 2:
The instructions are:

1. Style the above <h1> tag to use any color of your choice and a sans-serif font.
2. Style all <code> tags to use the monospace font-family and have red text.
3. Use a class selector to ensure that the <code> elements in the second <li> element have a different color (e.g. green).
4. Switch the order of the rules you created and use the dev tools of your browser to understand how specifity resolves conflicts (for the <code> elements).
5. Set a default font (e.g. sans-serif) for the entire content of your page and use "Inheritance" to change the font of the <li> items, too.
6. Use a combinator to give all <li> elements but the first one (!) a black background and white text color (don't worry if the numbers disappear).
7. Use another combinator to now give all <li> inside an <ol> element a black background and white text color.

Objective Section 3:

The instructions are:

1. Build a nice box (div) with some content (e.g. "I'm a box!"), padding, a border (style it as you want) and some margin.
2. If you didn't do it already: Set different padding and margin for the four different sides of the box.
3. Add the same box below the first box and note if you can identify any strange behavior.
4. Give the first box a height of 100% of the window height.
5. Set the first box back to a more reasonable height of 300px and set its width to 50%.
6. Position the two boxes next to each other.
7. "Hide" box number 1 and see how that changes the page.
8. Add a hover effect to the the LAST div element. Use pseudo-classes for that.
