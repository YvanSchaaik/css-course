Hello, and welcome to this app.

This app is something I am building because I have taken a course in CSS.
Inside there is a playground folder where the little tiny excercises are placed that I had to build in this course.
In this course I am learning about the very basics of CSS incl box-modeling, flexbox and SASS.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Objectives main project:

Objective 1

green background color
padding
set the width to the full page width

Pimp the text.

Objective 6.

Style the packages link.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective section 2:
The instructions are:

1. Style the above <h1> tag to use any color of your choice and a sans-serif font.
2. Style all <code> tags to use the monospace font-family and have red text.
3. Use a class selector to ensure that the <code> elements in the second <li> element have a different color (e.g. green).
4. Switch the order of the rules you created and use the dev tools of your browser to understand how specifity resolves conflicts (for the <code> elements).
5. Set a default font (e.g. sans-serif) for the entire content of your page and use "Inheritance" to change the font of the <li> items, too.
6. Use a combinator to give all <li> elements but the first one (!) a black background and white text color (don't worry if the numbers disappear).
7. Use another combinator to now give all <li> inside an <ol> element a black background and white text color.

Objective Section 3:

The instructions are:

1. Build a nice box (div) with some content (e.g. "I'm a box!"), padding, a border (style it as you want) and some margin.
2. If you didn't do it already: Set different padding and margin for the four different sides of the box.
3. Add the same box below the first box and note if you can identify any strange behavior.
4. Give the first box a height of 100% of the window height.
5. Set the first box back to a more reasonable height of 300px and set its width to 50%.
6. Position the two boxes next to each other.
7. "Hide" box number 1 and see how that changes the page.
8. Add a hover effect to the the LAST div element. Use pseudo-classes for that.


Objective Section 6:

The instructions are:

1. Go to our landing page in the course project and add a “margin-top” to our image (“#product-overview”) to ensure, that both the image and the slogan („Get the freedom you deserve“) are no longer hidden below the navigation bar.
2. Find a way to position the slogan in the left lower corner of the image using “px”. The slogan should have some space to the left and to the bottom but do NOT add a margin to it.
3. Change the positioning context of the slogan (challenge: What was the positioning context so far? What is the new positioning context?). Remember how we created the badge on the “Packages” page…
4. Adjust the position of the slogan using “%” values.
5. Switch to the “Packages” page.
6. Add a “z-index” of 10 to the badge (“.package__badge”). Scroll down on the webpage, what happens to the badge and what causes this issue?
7. Fix the issue encountered using the “z-index”. Make sure that the highest “z-index” on the entire page is the “z-index” of the badge (hint: Maybe the Stacking Context is a helpful concept in this situation, so you might have to add the “position” property again).

All done, great job!
